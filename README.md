# wat?

there are different things that are important to know about this system, which will be developed through the same mechanism that farcaster did. 

vibra is a livestreaming protocol, built on top of farcaster

every stream is a cast, and we make use of the social graph to determine the functionalities that will happen through the app, and the interactions that will happen between different members of the network (the network itself, channels, and users)

to the left, you see the streamers. these are the people that you follow that are streaming. 

think of these streams as a window into a creator's craft

on the top navigation bar, you will find 8 different channels

those represent channels on farcaster, and you will have the ability to hold, at any given time, 8 of these nfts on your connected identity to this system. that's how you will display what is seen here. you will chose those 8

each channel is an eternal thread of livestreams, and members of it will be able to own a token that represents their responsibility to hold space for what is happening on that channel, in that specific and unique moment (livestream to that channel)

(brands can also buy 30 minutes slots btw. this is how ads are done on the new world. by showing us practically why we should invest our energy on your product)

these slots of time are of 30 minutes, which means that the supply of them (for each farcaster channel) will be 336. 

people will be able to get several of them on different moments for a given channel, or 4 in a given day to account for two hours, you name it. that's the fun and unique part of it.

but this window will show the workings of creators in a way that the internet has not seen yet, because it will be based on the authenticity. this is a window into the truth of people, and it will only be through making this a window into them that we can walk towards that.

and that's why it will be built on top of quilibrium and farcaster. because of its people. of its willingness to walk towards the truth

let's make crypto cypherpunk again
